A beautiful learning management toolkit.

== Description ==

If you are looking for a intuitive and powerful WordPress LMS with no learning curve, you've come to the right place!

*   Perfectly integrates into your WordPress installation
*   Create media-rich courses in minutes
*   Focus on content, not setup!

= What is it exactly? =

Lucid LMS is a WordPress plugin that creates online learning experiences. It's great for companies who use learning for their staff or schools.

= How is Lucid different from other LMS plugins? =

When creating the software, we first of all thought of teachers, instructors and... developers!
Teachers, because they need a system to install with one click and start working on content instead of configuration.
Developers, because they deserve a nicely written, documented, extandable plugin they know how to customize.

= How is Lucid's workflow better than others? =

One of the features we take pride in is the course workflow. Most of other LMSs have you create a course
and have to populate all the information for it before you create lessons and quizzes.
But that's not how you think through the course, do you? Our workflow allows you to create an outline
of your courses before you work on the content. That lets you to plan
for your learning experience iteratively, just like in real life!

= Want to sell course? =

No problem. We integrate with WooCommerce, just install both plugins and enable WooCommerce support in settings.
